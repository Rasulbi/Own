#AI-Powered Price Prediction for Agricultural and Vegetable Markets
**Project Overview**

Farmers face a significant challenge: unpredictable crop and vegetable prices. Market rates fluctuate daily due to weather, supply-demand changes, and other conditions. Many farmers end up selling at the wrong time, leading to reduced profits or even losses.

Our project, AI-Powered Price Prediction for Agricultural and Vegetable Markets, aims to solve this problem by providing farmers with accurate price forecasts using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

**Features**

Real-Time Price Updates– Access daily updates of crop prices from different markets.

AI-Based Price Prediction – Predict future prices based on historical data, weather patterns, and demand trends.

Market-wise Comparison – Compare prices across different markets to choose the best selling option.

Weather-Aware Predictions – Factor in weather conditions to improve prediction accuracy.

Price Alerts – Receive alerts when crop prices are high, helping farmers decide the best selling time.

**Technology Stack**

Backend: Python, Machine Learning

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Chart.js (for interactive visual charts)

Database: MySQL (to store historical and current market data)

**How It Works**

The system collects historical crop price data and relevant weather information.

Machine Learning models analyze past patterns to predict future prices.

Predictions are displayed through easy-to-read charts on the frontend.

Farmers can view upcoming price trends and receive alerts to make informed decisions.

**Benefits**

Enables data-driven decisions for selling crops.

Helps farmers maximize profits and reduce losses.

Promotes smart agriculture through AI-based insights.

Easy to understand with visual charts and alerts.

**Future Enhancements**

Integration of IoT sensors for yield prediction.

Voice-based support in local languages for better accessibility.

Mobile app version for real-time market updates on-the-go.

**Getting Started**
